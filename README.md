# Galena

A game engine written in modern C++17 intended for portable desktop and mobile support (though we are windows only right now) using opengl, vulkan, and dx12 (though we only use opengl es 3.2 right now).

## TODO: lots of stuff

* Implement vulkan back end
* Implement directx back end
* Move to cmake
* Make dependencies more explicit

... and lots more
